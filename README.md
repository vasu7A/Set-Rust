# Rust Math Sets

This repository provides a simple implementation of mathematical set operations in Rust, using generics and standard library collections. It supports basic set operations like union, intersection, difference, and element management. The implementation uses `HashSet` from the Rust standard library to manage the elements of the set.

## Features

- **Generics**: Supports sets of any type `T` that implements `Eq`, `Hash`, and `Clone`.
- **Basic Operations**: Union, Intersection, Difference.
- **Element Management**: Add, Remove, Check Existence.
- **Debugging**: Includes derived `Debug` and `Clone` traits for easy printing and cloning.
